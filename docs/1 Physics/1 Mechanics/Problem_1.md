Projectile motion

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the acceleration due to gravity. It follows a curved path (a parabola) and occurs in two dimensions: horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis).

To analyze projectile motion, we separate the motion into horizontal and vertical components:

⸻

1. Horizontal Motion (x-direction)

	•	There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction (assuming air resistance is negligible), so velocity remains constant:

v_x = v_0 \cos \theta

	•	The horizontal distance or range is given by:

x = v_0 \cos \theta \cdot t

⸻

2. Vertical Motion (y-direction)
	•	The vertical motion is influenced by gravity:

v_y = v_0 \sin \theta - g t

	•	The vertical displacement at any time t:

y = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2

	•	At the maximum height, the vertical velocity becomes zero:

v_y = 0 \Rightarrow t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0 \sin \theta}{g}

	•	Maximum height reached:
    
H = \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{2g}

⸻

3. Time of Flight (total time in the air)

For a projectile launched and landing at the same height:

T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}

⸻

4. Range (Horizontal Distance Traveled)

R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}

⸻

Summary
	•	Initial velocity: v_0
	•	Launch angle: \theta
	•	Acceleration due to gravity: g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2

Projectile motion is a classic example of 2D motion under constant acceleration. It is widely used in physics, engineering, and sports science to predict the path of thrown or launched objects.
